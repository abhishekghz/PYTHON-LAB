# PRACTICAL 01
# Write a program to demonstrate different number data types in Python.

a = 10
b = 11.5
c = 2.05j
# d = "Abhishek"
print(" a is Type of ", type(a))
print(" b is Type of ", type(b))
print(" c is Type of ", type(c))
# print(" d is Type of ", type(d))

# or

x = 20
print(x)
print(type(x))
y = 20.5
print(x)
print(type(y))
z = 15j
print(x)
print(type(z))
